## Change Log

- 2025-02-26 (V 0.3.4). 
    - Modified the `shuffle_order` function to ensure full derangement, making convergence faster. 
- 2025-03-06 (V 0.4.0)
    - use `pyproject.toml` instead
    - update `conjuage_priors_algo.py`, now without using the auxiliary variable of `participant_stages`. Kept the uncertainties just like in `soft_kmeans_algo.py`. 
- 2025-03-07 (V 0.4.2)
    - Compute `new_ln_likelihood_new_theta_phi` based on `new_theta_phi_estimates`, which is based on `stage_likelihoods_posteriors` that is based on the newly proposed order and previous `theta_phi_estimates`.
    - Update `theta_phi_estimates` with `new_theta_phi_estimates` only if new order is accepted.
    - The fallback theta_phi_estimates is the previous parameters rather than theta_phi_default 
    - `all_accepted_orders.append(current_order_dict.copy())` to make sure the results are not mutated. 
    - Previously I calculated the `new_ln_likelihood` and `stage_likelihoods_posteriors` based on the newly proposed order and previous `theta_phi_estimates`, and directly update theta_phi_estimates whether we accept the new order or not. 
    - Previously, I excluded `copy()` in `all_accepted_orders.append(current_order_dict.copy())`, which is inaccurate. 
- 2025-03-17 (V 0.4.3)
    - Added `skip` and `title_detail` parameter in `save_traceplot` function. 
- 2025-03-18 (V 0.4.4)
    - Add optional horizontal bar indicating upper limit in trace plot. 
- 2025-03-18 (V 0.4.7)
    - Allowed keeping all cols (`keep_all_cols`) in data generation. 
- 2025-03-18 (V 0.4.9)
    - copy `data_we_have` and use `data_we_have.loc[:, 'S_n']` in soft kmeans algo when preprocessing participant and biomarker data.
- 2025-03-20 (V 0.5.1)
    - In hard kmeans, updated `delta = ln_likelihood - current_ln_likelihood`, and in soft kmeans and conjugate priors, made sure I am using `delta = new_ln_likelihood_new_theta_phi - current_ln_likelihood`.
    - In each iteration, use `theta_phi_estimates = theta_phi_default.copy()` first. This means, `stage_likelihoods_posteriors` is based on the default theta_phi, not the previous iteration. 
- 2025-03-21 (V 0.6.0)
    - Integrated all three algorithms to just one file `algorithms/algorithm.py`. 
    - Changed the algorithm name of `soft_kmeans` to `mle` (maximum likelihood estimation)
    - Moved all helper functions from the algorithm script to `utils/data_processing.py`. 
- 2025-03-22 (V 0.7.6)
    - Current state should include both the current accepted order and its associated theta/phi. When updating theta/phi at the start of each iteration, use the current state's theta/phi (1) in the calculation of stage likelihoods and (2) as the fallback if either of the biomarker's clusters is empty or has only one measurement; (3) as the prior mean and variance. 
    - Set `conjugate_priors` as the default algorithm. 
    - (Tried using cluster's mean and var as the prior but the results are not as good as using current state's theta/phi as the prior). 
- 2025-03-24 (V 0.7.8)
    - In heatmap, reorder the biomarkers according to the most likely order. 
    - In `results.json` reorder the biomarker according to their order rather than alphabetically ranked. 
    - Modified `obtain_most_likely_order_dic` so that we assign stages for biomarkers that have the highest probabilities first. 
    - In `results.json`, output the order associated with the highest total log likelihood. Also, calculate the kendall's tau and p values of it and the original order (if provided).
- 2025-03-25 (V 0.8.1)
    - In heatmap, reorder according to the order with highest log likelihood. Also, add the number just like (1).
    - Able to add title detail to heatmaps and traceplots. 
    - Able to add `fname_prefix` in `run_ebm()`. 
- 2025-03-29 (V 0.8.9)
    - Added `em` algorithm. 
    - Added Dirichlet-Multinomial Model to describe uncertainy of stage distribution (a multinomial disribution of all disease stages; because we cannot always assume all disease stages are equally likely).
    - `prior_v` default set to be 1. 
    - Default to use dirichlet distribution instead of uniform distribution 
    - Change data filename from 50|100_1 to 50_100_1. 
    - Modified the `mle` algorithm to make sure the output does not contain `np.nan` (by using the fallback).

- 2025-03-30 (V 0.9.2)
    - Completed changed `generate_data.py`. Now incorporates the modified data generation model based on DEBM2019.
    - Rank the original order by the value (ascending), if original order exists. 
    - Able to skip saving traceplots and/or heatmaps.

- 2025-03-31 (V 0.9.4)
    - Able to store final theta phi estimates and the final stage likelihood posteior to results.json

- 2025-04-02 (V 0.9.5)
    - Added `kde` algorithm. 
    - Initial kmeans used seeded Kmeans + conjugate priors. 

## Generate Random Data

```py
from alabebm import generate, get_params_path, get_biomarker_order_path
import os
import json 

# Get path to default parameters
params_file = get_params_path()

# Get path to biomarker_order
biomarker_order_json = get_biomarker_order_path()

with open(biomarker_order_json, 'r') as file:
    biomarker_order = json.load(file)

generate(
    biomarker_order = biomarker_order,
    real_theta_phi_file=params_file,  # Use default parameters
    js = [50, 100],
    rs = [0.1, 0.5],
    num_of_datasets_per_combination=2,
    output_dir='my_data',
    seed = None,
    prefix = None,
    suffix = None,
    keep_all_cols = False
)
```

## Run MCMC Algorithms 

```py
from alabebm import run_ebm
from alabebm.data import get_sample_data_path
import os

print("Current Working Directory:", os.getcwd())

for algorithm in ['soft_kmeans', 'conjugate_priors', 'hard_kmeans']:
    results = run_ebm(
        data_file=get_sample_data_path('25|50_10.csv'),  # Use the path helper
        algorithm=algorithm,
        n_iter=2000,
        n_shuffle=2,
        burn_in=1000,
        thinning=20,
        correct_ordering = None,
        plot_title_detail = "",
    )
```

## Interpreting the results 

After running the algorithm, you'll get the results in the folder of `conjugate_priors`, including 

- `heatmaps`. This folder contains the heatmap. Note that the number following each biomarker, such as (1), indicates the order of this biomarker according to the order that is associated with the highest likelihood (You can see the folder of `traceplots` for the likelihood history.)
- `records` contains the logging information of the algorithm. 
- `traceplots` contains the traceplots of log likelihood trajectory. 
- `results` contains json files. Example of a result json:

```json
{
    "n_iter": 200,
    "most_likely_order": {
        "HIP-FCI": 1,
        "PCC-FCI": 2,
        "FUS-GMI": 3,
        "P-Tau": 4,
        "AB": 5,
        "HIP-GMI": 6,
        "MMSE": 7,

    },
    "order_with_higest_ll": {
        "HIP-FCI": 1,
        "PCC-FCI": 2,
        "FUS-GMI": 3,
        "AB": 4,
        "P-Tau": 5,
        "HIP-GMI": 6,
        "MMSE": 7,

    "p_value2": 0.009148478835978836
}
```

`n_iter` means the number of iterations. `most_likely_order` is the most likely order if we consider all the iteration results, burn in, and thinning. `kendalls_tau` and `p_value` is the result of most likely order versus the original order (if provided). `order_with_higest_ll` is the order associated with the highest log likelihood. `kendalls_tau2` and `p_value2` is the result of most likely order versus the original order (if provided). 


## Input data

The input data should have at least four columns:

- participant: int
- biomarker: str
- measurement: float
- diseased: bool 

An example is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongtaoh/alabEBM/refs/heads/main/alabEBM/tests/my_data/10%7C100_0.csv

The data should be in a [tidy format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), i.e.,

- Each variable is a column. 
- Each observation is a row. 
- Each type of observational unit is a table. 

## Features

- Multiple MCMC algorithms:
    - Conjugate Priors
    - Hard K-means
    - MLE

- Data generation utilities
- Extensive logging
